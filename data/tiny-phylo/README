This directory holds an internally consistent set of phylogenetic analyses on
a tiny dataset to test the pipeline.

The model.txt file holds the phylogenetic model used for all of these
calculations.

Directories are complete input/outputs from the pipeline. These can be
regenerated using alignment-to-ancestors.ipynb.

Other directories: 

+ 04_bootstraps_toy: a gene tree bootstrap directory with only four replicates
  rather than the full complement.
+ 05_reconcile-bootstraps_toy: a reconciled tree bootstrap directory with only
  four replicates rather than the full complement.
+ final-output: final output from all directories compiled into a single
  location
+ initial-input: input files used to run pipeline
+ toy-reconcile-bootstraps-running: a simulated bootstrap reconciliation run
  in progress. (See it's README for details.)
